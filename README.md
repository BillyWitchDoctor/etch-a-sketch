JJ's Etch-a-Sketch Game for TOP

3/2/23 - I will be following The Odin Project's "Etch-a-Sketch" assignment and attempting to use the skills I've learned so far in the program to create some sort of etch-a-sketch game using primarily DOM manipulation methods. This will also be an attempt for me to get better at using git and writing useful, concise git commit messages and committing early and often!
